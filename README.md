# CLIENT-SERVER-MODEL

Client-Server Distributed Application focused on creating a Moodle where you can consult your schedule, tasks and marks. The server was made in JavaScript using the Node.js library, and is responsible of managing the input (HTTP get requests) from the diverse clients. In order to achieve this, the server consults a Relational MySQL DataBase stored locally at my computer. This DataBase contains all the users with their marks, schedule and tasks. So, when the server receives an HTTP GET request (which in our case were included in the url as : "ip_addres?xxx&xxx&xxx ") it processes the restrictions and data and translates it to a SQL petition. It sends it to the DataBase, and once it receives response it returns it in .JSON format to the respective clients.
Finally, we made 3 different clients : Web App, Android and RaspberryPi with Ruby
The WebApp Client was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As JavaScript supports asynchronous methods, we did not have to implement threads and distributed paradigmas. The Android client was done using Java. Finally, for the Ruby client we had to use thread implementation in order to not freeze the graphics system while waiting for a response. It is worth mentioning that in the Ruby client we created a Radio-Frequency-Identification(RFID) method using the Raspberry to authenticate in the server with our University cards.
